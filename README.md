Machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Regularized Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting Classifier, along with explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques, were employed to develop a comprehensive risk model. Each model's robustness were evaluated based on accuracy, classification reports, and the underlying transparency or explainability.
