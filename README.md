                                    Mortgage Loan Default Prediction Using Machine Learning

Machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Regularized Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting Classifier, along with explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques, were employed to develop a comprehensive risk model. Each model's robustness were evaluated based on accuracy, classification reports, and the underlying transparency or explainability.
